#####Notes on doing a paired project:

We primarily worked concurrently, using the Driver/Navigator method, switching when we completed one feature/functionality (so we each got practice in typing and in talking it out).

We pushed and pulled from GitHub to practice workflow (as if we weren't working concurrently), and we each got to practice jQuery and CSS.
